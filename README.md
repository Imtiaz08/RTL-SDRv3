RTL-SDR Blog R820T2 RTL2832U 1PPM TCXO SMA 

This is an RTL-SDR software defined radio receiver with RTL2832U ADC chip, 1PPM TCXO, SMA F connector, aluminium case with passive cooling, R820T2 tuner. Tunes from 500 kHz to 1.7 GHz with up to 3.2 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth. (HF mode works in direct sampling mode - V3 and above only). Perfect for use as a computer based radio scanner with free software like SDR#, HDSDR, SDR-Radio, Linrad, GQRX or SDR Touch on Android. Works on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android and even embedded Linux computers like the Raspberry Pi. 

Great for many applications including general radio scanning, air traffic control, public safety radio, ADS-B aircraft radar, AIS boat radar, ACARS, trunked radio, P25/MotoTRBO digital voice, POCSAG, weather balloons, APRS, NOAA APT weather satellites, Meteor M2 satellites, radio astronomy, meteor scatter monitoring, DAB, or for use as a low cost panadapter with a traditional ham radio. 

This model has several improvements over other models. It uses the improved R820T2 tuner, comes with a 1PPM TCXO (no drift and accurate tuning with a 2 PPM initial offset and 1 PPM temperature drift), improved component tolerances and an SMA F connector. It also comes with a software activatable bias-tee circuit for powering external devices such as LNA's and active antennas. 

Requires a USB 2.0 Port and works on most USB 3.0 ports (note that we cannot guarantee it to work on all USB 3.0 ports, please ensure your PC has a USB 2.0 port just in case). Installation on Windows is simple. Please Google for the free RTL-SDR Quickstart Guide for installation instructions. For custom antennas please note that this dongle uses an SMA F connector (note not RP-SMA).
